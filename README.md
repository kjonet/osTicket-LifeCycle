<h1> osTicket - Lifecyle Simulation </h1>

<p>In this tutorial, we will act as both the end user and agents created inorder to simulate what working a ticketing system can feel like. We will submit a ticket as a end user, address it as an agent and close it out. </p>

<h3> Step 1:</h3>

<p>Click the link below to navigate to the end user osTicket home page and select “Open a New Ticket”.  </p>

</br>


</br>

<h3> Step 2: </h3>

<p> Using the user credentials created in the last osTickect Post Configuration lab, we will enter the credentials for one of our users and write out our problem for the agents to solve. In this case, the user Tina is having issues logging into her Outlook and is in need of a password reset. Here, Tina is able to provide her contact information and select a help topic to assist in catagorizing her problem. She will need to select the “Password Reset” help topic and provide a brief description of the issue. Then she will hit “Creat Ticket”
. </p>

<h3> Step 3: </h3>

<p>On the agent side, we will be logging in as one of the agents created earlier from the previous lab. Once logged in, we will beb able to see any open tickets on our dashboard.</p>

</br>

<p> In this case, Alex will select the open ticket and evaluate its contents such as, who submitted, the create date, the status of the ticket, the department and priority level.</p>

</br>

<p>For this demonstration, Alex will go ahead and assign the ticket to himself by clicking on where it says “-Unassigned-” . We will keep the priority set to “Normal” since this is a pretty standard issue and procedure. He can aslo assign the SLA but for this demonstrtaion, we will leave it at the defuault. </p>




</br>

<h3>Step 4: </h3>

<p>Alex has gone ahead and solved the ticket but before he can close it out, he will verify with the end user if their problem was solved.</p>

</br>

<p>After the end user verifies that everything works, the agent will document this in the ticketing system. Documentation is importan incase similar problems arise and other agents will have an idea on how to solve the issue.  </p>

</br>


<h3>Step 5:</h3>

<p>Since the end user has confired that everything is working as it should, the Agent can go ahead and resolve the ticket, thus, closing it. </h3>
